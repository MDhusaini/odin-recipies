    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavner, which means it helps the banana bread rise. </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
        <li>Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
        <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.        </li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
        <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
